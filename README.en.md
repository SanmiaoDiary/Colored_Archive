## Basic Information
Chinese game name: 彩色档案  
English game name: ColordeArchive  
Game abbreviation: CA (We hope you will call it this, but of course, it's also fine if you want to give it another name)
## Project Introduction
This is a 2D pixel-style RTT (Real-Time Tactics) game developed using the pygame library and based on Python  
We hope to make it a fan game of "Azure Archives" (if possible, of course)  
You can download and use its source code for free, but you cannot use it for profit. We hope everyone can derive happiness from it, rather than seeking profits  
The font used in the game, Minecraft AE, is sourced from the internet  
## Deploying the project
If you wish to run this project on your device, please follow the steps below:
1. ### Configure the runtime environment
   Please ensure that you have Python and the PyGame library installed on your device, and that the version of Python is 3.13.7 or above. If you haven't installed Python, you can download it from the [Python official website](http://python.org)  
    Then install Python according to the installation program  
    Press Windows+R to open the Run program, and enter cmd  
    If you don't know whether Python is installed on your device  
    Taking the Windows operating system as an example  
    You can use this command to check if you have installed Python  
    ```
    python
    ```
    If the Python interpreter and version number appear, it indicates that you have already installed Python  
    If it does not appear, it indicates that the installation has failed, and you may need to reinstall Python  
    Next, let's check if you have installed pygame  
    It is still entered in cmd  
    ```
    python -m pygame -version
    ```
    If the version number of pygame appears, it indicates that you have already installed pygame  
    If an error message appears, it indicates that you have not installed pygame
    You can use this command to install pygame  
    ```
    pip install pygame  
    ```
    After installation, please follow the steps above to check whether the installation is successful
